        I’m Travis — a Cloud Engineer in training with a strong focus on AWS,
        Linux, and deployment. I’m early in my cloud journey, building a solid
        foundation before moving into more advanced areas like automation and
        DevOps. Before tech, I spent 13 years managing large commercial painting
        projects, which taught me leadership, problem-solving, and staying calm
        under pressure. I also build front-end projects with React and
        JavaScript to strengthen my overall skill set and create real
        applications I can deploy to the cloud. I’m hands-on, direct, and
        constantly improving. My goal is to grow into a cloud role where I can
        keep learning and contribute to real technical teams.
